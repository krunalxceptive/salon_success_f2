## Changelog

Changelog:
- September 8, 2025. Enhanced ActiveCampaign integration with automatic tagging for new user signups. Users are now automatically tagged with "salonsuccessmanager" when they register or sign up, in addition to being added to the KG Business Mentor list. The system creates the tag if it doesn't exist and applies it to both new and existing contacts during signup process. Fixed critical list assignment issue where ACTIVECAMPAIGN_LIST_ID environment variable contained a full URL instead of numeric ID, causing 500 errors during list assignment. Successfully resolved session callback issues by moving ActiveCampaign integration to execute immediately after user creation rather than within session save callbacks. The integration now properly tags new users and adds them to the KG Business Mentor list as intended.
- September 2, 2025. Implemented comprehensive developer notification system for new user registrations. Added email notifications to help@salonsuccessmanager.com for all user activities: registration, promo code usage (CLIENT6FREE), subscription creation, and payment success events. Notifications include user details, business type, signup method, and quick action items for follow-up.
- September 2, 2025. Fixed hourly rate calculator number input formatting for Safari and international usage. Added support for comma-separated numbers (10,000), changed inputs from 'number' to 'text' type for Safari compatibility, implemented automatic comma formatting as users type, and updated parsing to handle commas properly when calculating rates. Calculator now works consistently across all browsers.
- August 21, 2025. Fixed CLIENT6FREE promo code authentication flow completely. Resolved race condition where Stripe subscription creation was overriding promo code status by adding free_access check in create-subscription route. Updated frontend to avoid problematic redirects that lose session cookies. CLIENT6FREE users now get immediate dashboard access with 6 months free access to all business tools.
- August 21, 2025. Enhanced registration page with password confirmation and visibility toggles. Added password confirmation field with matching validation, eye/eye-off icons for password visibility, and improved form security. Updated reset password page to use consistent help@salonsuccessmanager.com contact email.
- August 21, 2025. Fixed stock budget calculator "Add Purchase" button not responding. Resolved identical schema validation issue where userId was required in insertStockPurchaseSchema but should be added by server. Updated insertStockPurchaseSchema to exclude userId from validation. Stock purchase creation now works properly with automatic budget calculations and purchase history tracking.
- August 21, 2025. Fixed validation error in profit margin calculator preventing treatment creation. Resolved schema validation issue where userId was required in request body but should be added by server. Updated insertTreatmentSchema to exclude userId from validation.

- August 20, 2025. Fixed critical payment system issue preventing subscription form loading. Resolved "unable to load payment form" error by implementing Setup Intent approach for payment method collection. Switched from payment intent-based subscriptions to Setup Intent + subscription model, ensuring proper client secret generation for Stripe Elements integration. Payment system now fully functional with proper recurring payment setup.
- August 14, 2025. Updated application branding from "Salon Growth Manager" to "Salon Success Manager" across all pages, titles, and documentation. Added AED (UAE Dirham) currency support for international clients. Completed comprehensive currency context integration ensuring all pages respond to currency selection changes.
